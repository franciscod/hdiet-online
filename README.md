# The Hacker's Diet Online

This is an attempt to get HDO up and running, started by someone with no prior experience whatsoever with Perl.

    docker-compose up --build


## perl hackers wanted

Currently uses a very old Ubuntu: Precise Pangolin (12.04 LTS).

I've tried to use a newer base image but there are a few perl errors that I'm not sure how to fix.

Updating to a modern perl would be ideal! Feel free to submit patches for this :)
